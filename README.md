## Description



## Prerequisites

To use the charts here, [Helm](https://helm.sh/) must be configured for your
Kubernetes cluster. Setting up Kubernetes and Helm is outside the scope of
this README. Please refer to the Kubernetes and Helm documentation.

The versions required are:

  * **Helm 3.6+**
  * **Kubernetes 1.16+** - This is the earliest version of Kubernetes tested.
    It is possible that this chart works with earlier versions but it is
    untested.

## Usage

Run the following script for the full setup.
```sh
./setup.sh
```
